## Reflection

My main challenge was never having used SQL databases until this lesson. It was alot to learn. I based these examples off of what we covered in class. I was unfamiliar with the command-line interface for SQLite, so I focused on working entirely within VS Code. I like the simplicity that SQL can work with JavaScript and Python similarly. There weren't many differences in the syntax going from Python to JavaScript. My previous experience has been with MongoDB/Express, where referencing another ID is done by using `ref:`. It was interesting to learn that it works the same as `FOREIGN KEY` in SQLite. This realization helped to understand the relationship between foreign keys much better.
